# 📖 User Stories

This folder captures the core user interactions for our Airbnb-Clone backend. Each story is distilled from the use-case diagram and describes **who** wants **what** and **why**—a foundation for estimating, planning and development.

## 📁 Directory Structure

├── README.md  ← you’re here  
└── user-stories.md ← detailed list of user stories  

## 🎯 Purpose

- Translate visual use cases into actionable development tasks  
- Align backend API design and workflows with real user needs  
- Serve as input for sprint planning, acceptance criteria and test cases  

## 📝 How to Use

1. Open **user-stories.md** to review each story.  
2. For each story, define:
   - Acceptance criteria  
   - API endpoints and payloads  
   - Data validation rules  
3. During refinement sessions, break stories into smaller tasks (sub-stories) as needed.  
4. Link each story to corresponding GitHub issues or tickets for traceability.  

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add acceptance criteria under each user story  
- Estimate story points and prioritize for upcoming sprints  
- Gather feedback from stakeholders and iterate
